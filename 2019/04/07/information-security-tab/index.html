    <h1 class="article-title">Use R to add a Data Disclaimer to an Excel Report</h1>

    <span class="article-date">4/7/2019</span>
    

    <div class="article-content">
	
	<!--<p>If you work  exclusively with clean data that can be accessed and distributed freely without fear of legal action then (1) I envy you and (2) this read is probably not for you.-->

	<p>I work with confidential and restricted data in a legal/regulatory environment. Data needs to be accurate and secure.  A robust disclaimer can go a long way in helping meet those needs.

	<p>In this post we will use R to:
		<ul>
			<li>Wrangle data from the <em>hrsample</em> database</li>
			<li>Create a basic human resources summary report in Excel</li>
			<li>Add a simple data disclaimer tab to our report</li>
		</ul>
	<p>You can find the R script here: <a href = "https://github.com/harryahlas/sample-hr-database/blob/master/analysis/data_disclaimer_tab.R">https://github.com/harryahlas/sample-hr-database/blob/master/analysis/data_disclaimer_tab.R</a>.

	<h3 class="article-subtitle">Ever in Our Favor</h3>

	<p>My team often distributes our data in Excel format.  If you are cringing, no worries, bear with me. Legal and regulatory reporting is often better left vanilla. Excel/PDF/csv etc reports are more suitable for this type of work than, say, a dynamic Tableau dashboard or Shiny app. 
	
	<p>The good news is we can turn this archaic Excel reporting practice in our favor.  We can leverage Excel's ability to have multiple tabs in one workbook to create a data disclaimer.  The disclaimer will accomplish two things: 
	
	<ol class="task-list">
		<li><label>Clearly explain to our client how, if at all, s/he can distribute our data.</label></li>
		<li><label>Help the client understand the data, mitigating risk and reducing the chance of confusion.</label></li>
	</ol>

	<p>I can't emphasize enough how critical it is to proactively clarify anything that might potentially confuse the client.  The disclaimer tab is the perfect opportunity to do so. The disclaimer tab can go a long way in avoiding confusion and - as a result - save time and money down the line.  We'll see an example of this in a bit. 

	<h3 class="article-subtitle">The Data</h3>

	<p>For this report, we will use the <em>hrsample</em> database (more info <a href="/2019/03/17/hrsample-database/index.html">here</a>), which can be installed with <code>devtools::install_github("harryahlas/hrsample")</code>. Let's say a legal team at this imaginary company wants to know what the company's job headcount and turnover looked like in 2009.  
	
	<p>Let's begin with the R script.  First things first, let's load packages, create a report name/number for tracking as well as an as of date:

	<p><div class="scrollbox" style="display: grid;height: 100%;" tabindex="0">
		<pre class="scrollbox-content">
library(hrsample)
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(lubridate)
library(openxlsx)

report_name &#60;- "PA73405 - Attrition by Job 2009"
as_of_date &#60;- Sys.Date()</pre></div>


	<p>Next, let's take a closer look at our data from <em>hrsample</em>.  There are two key tables we are interested in here. We can use <code>deskjob_table</code> and <code>deskhistory_table</code> in conjunction to determine all the employees' movement information.

<!--	<pre class="R">
deskhistory_table &#60;- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryahlas/sample-hr-database/master/data/deskhistory_table.csv")
deskjob_table &#60;- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harryahlas/sample-hr-database/master/data/deskjob_table.csv")
</pre> -->

<p><code>deskjob_table</code> - this data associates each desk/position to a specific job.
<p><div class="scrollbox" style="display: grid;height: 100%;" tabindex="0">
		<pre class="scrollbox-content">knitr::kable(deskjob_table[sample(nrow(deskjob_table),5),])
|     | desk_id|job_name    |
|:----|-------:|:-----------|
|777  |     777|Salesperson |
|1039 |    1039|Analyst     |
|423  |     423|Salesperson |
|503  |     503|Salesperson |
|1123 |    1123|Developer   |</pre></div>

<p><code>deskhistory_table</code> - this data captures the start and end dates for each employee's job.  It also captures whether the job resulted in a termination and if the job came as the result of a promotion.
<p><div class="scrollbox" style="display: grid;height: 100%;" tabindex="0">
		<pre class="scrollbox-content">knitr::kable(deskhistory_table[sample(nrow(deskhistory_table),5),])
|      | employee_num| desk_id|desk_id_start_date |desk_id_end_date | termination_flag| promotion_flag|
|:-----|------------:|-------:|:------------------|:----------------|----------------:|--------------:|
|687   |        27083|     687|1999-01-01         |2000-05-11       |                0|              0|
|10015 |        22657|     677|2018-12-14         |2999-01-01       |                1|              1|
|1327  |        36399|     888|2000-03-17         |2002-10-06       |                1|              1|
|6431  |        18508|    1069|2011-06-20         |2012-12-19       |                0|              0|
|4962  |        24300|     424|2008-02-23         |2013-05-17       |                1|              0|</pre></div>

	<p>You'll notice both tables share a variable <code>desk_id</code>. You can think of <code>desk_id</code> as the employee's unique desk number.  The <code>desk_id_start_date</code> and <code>desk_id_end_date</code> variables refer to the dates the employee was at that "desk".  If the employee switched to a new job somewhere else in the company they would likely switch to a new <code>desk_id</code>.  The <code>desk_id</code> is a critical key: from <code>desk_id</code> we can determine what job, location, manager, line of business, etc. belongs to the employee assigned to that <code>desk_id</code>.

	<h3 class="article-subtitle">Summarize Data with Tidyverse</h3>

	<p>Now that we have the raw data, let's use some standard dplyr/tidyr functions to join the two datasets and create a simple data frame that summarizes turnover and headcount by job.   First, we will create a new object called <code>hcto_summary</code> (headcount/turnover summary) by joining our two tables. The default join will be on <code>desk_id</code>.  
	
	<p><div class="scrollbox" style="display: grid;height: 100%;" tabindex="0">
		<pre class="scrollbox-content">hcto_summary &#60;- deskhistory_table %>% 
  left_join(deskjob_table) %>%</pre></div>
	
	<p>Next, we'll filter for all rows that have data for 2009.
	<p><div class="scrollbox" style="display: grid;height: 100%;" tabindex="0">
		<pre class="scrollbox-content">  filter(desk_id_start_date &lt;= as.Date("2009-12-31"),
         desk_id_end_date &gt;= as.Date("2009-01-01")) %>%</pre></div>

	<p>Some employees will have multiple jobs in 2009.  Since we only want to count each employee once, let's take their most recent job for this report. We have to account for the fact that some employees would have switched jobs in 2009.  These employees would have multiple entries during that year, probably for different <code>desk_id</code>s. This is something we will call out on our disclaimer tab later on in order to avoid confusion down the line. 
	
	<p>In order to count the most recent job for each employee who was active in 2009, we can sort the data with the  most recent <code>desk_id_end_date</code> and then <code>group_by(employee_num) %>% filter(row_number() == 1)</code> in order to select the most recent of those jobs.  This is a nifty trick I use a lot, and we will be sure to document it in the disclaimer.

	<p><div class="scrollbox" style="display: grid;height: 100%;" tabindex="0">
		<pre class="scrollbox-content">  arrange(desc(desk_id_end_date)) %>% 
  group_by(employee_num) %>% 
  filter(row_number() == 1) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%</pre></div>

	<p>Next, we'll clean up some of the variables and names to make the data easier for the end user to digest.  Here we will also calculate our key metric: if an employee's last day in a desk (<code>desk_id_end_date</code>) was in 2009 and they terminated, then they will be flagged as a termination.
 	<p><div class="scrollbox" style="display: grid;height: 100%;" tabindex="0">
		<pre class="scrollbox-content">  mutate(year = "2009",
         termination_flag = if_else(termination_flag == 1 & year(desk_id_end_date) == 2009, 
                                    "Terminated", 
                                    "DidNotTerminate")) %>% </pre></div>

   <p>The last piece is some wrangling, starting with a count of jobs separating out terminations.  The <code>spread</code> function will pivot the data so there is a column for <code>Terminated</code> and a column for <code>DidNotTerminate</code>.  We'll also calculate total <code>Headcount</code> and <code>TerminationRate</code> columns.

	<p><div class="scrollbox" style="display: grid;height: 100%;" tabindex="0">
		<pre class="scrollbox-content">  count(job_name, termination_flag) %>% 
  spread(termination_flag, n, fill = 0) %>% 
  mutate(Headcount =  Terminated + DidNotTerminate,
         TerminationRate = percent(Terminated / Headcount)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Terminated / Headcount))</pre></div>

	<p>Please note <code>spread</code> will be replaced with <code>pivot_wide</code> in the near future!
	<p>Here is all the code together. I love <em>tidyverse</em>.
	<p><div class="scrollbox" style="display: grid;height: 100%;" tabindex="0">
		<pre class="scrollbox-content">hcto_summary &#60;- deskhistory_table %>% 
  left_join(deskjob_table) %>% 
  filter(desk_id_start_date &lt;= as.Date("2009-12-31"),
         desk_id_end_date &gt;= as.Date("2009-01-01")) %>% 
  arrange(desc(desk_id_end_date)) %>% 
  group_by(employee_num) %>% 
  filter(row_number() == 1) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(year = "2009",
         termination_flag = if_else(termination_flag == 1 & year(desk_id_end_date) == 2009, 
                                    "Terminated", 
                                    "DidNotTerminate")) %>% 
  count(year, job_name, termination_flag) %>% 
  spread(termination_flag, n, fill = 0) %>% 
  mutate(Headcount =  Terminated + DidNotTerminate,
         TerminationRate = percent(Terminated / Headcount)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Terminated / Headcount))</pre></div>

	<p>Here is the output data that we want to send to the clients:

	<h3 class="article-subtitle">Data Disclaimer Tab</h3>

<p>With the retrieval and manipulation behind us, the data is almost ready to export. We are now at the data disclaimer piece. Before continuing, I need to mention this disclaimer is very basic and for demonstration purposes only.   <b>Always consult your legal team for approval of external disclaimer verbiage</b>.

<p>This disclaimer will include distribution information as well as information about how the data was pulled.  This is our shot to clarify the way we are counting employees (only count the most recent 2009 job). The client typically doesn't have time to think about these types of details, so making this clarification now will prepare your client for questions and potentially save you from urgent follow up scrambles that no one enjoys.

<p>I have packaged this example's verbiage into a data frame:

<p><div class="scrollbox" style="display: grid;height: 100%;" tabindex="0">
		<pre class="scrollbox-content">disclaimer_info &#60;- data.frame(Information = 
  c("Source: hrsample",
    paste("Data as of", as_of_date, "."),
    "Data includes all employees rolling up to CEO Danica Hammel who were active at any point from Jan 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009.",
    "If the employee had multiple jobs during 2009, only the most recent job is counted.",
    "Data is confidential and should be shared on a need to know basis only.",
    "Do not distribute externally."))</pre></div>

	<p>Note that the text is enclosed in a concatenation <code> c("xxx", "yyy", "zzz")</code>.  The <em>openxlsx</em> package will look for the commas between quotations and determine that words that come after the commas go into a new row in Excel.

	<h3 class="article-subtitle">Export to Excel</h3>

	<p>I tend to favor the <em>openxlsx</em> package over others for exporting to Excel.  It seems less error prone because it is not dependent on Java.  With that, let's start by creating a new Excel workbook object <code>wb</code> and adding two tabs: the first for the data summary and the second for the disclaimer.

<p><div class="scrollbox" style="display: grid;height: 100%;" tabindex="0">
		<pre class="scrollbox-content">wb &#60;- createWorkbook()
addWorksheet(wb, report_name)
addWorksheet(wb, "Data Disclaimer")</pre></div>

	<p>Now we can write our summary and disclaimer data frames to each sheet.  The numbers 1 and 2 below are the sheet numbers.

	<p><div class="scrollbox" style="display: grid;height: 100%;" tabindex="0">
		<pre class="scrollbox-content">writeDataTable(wb, 1, hcto_summary)
writeDataTable(wb, 2, disclaimer_info)</pre></div>

	<p>Next, let's add just a touch of formatting to sheet #2, our disclaimer tab.  Let's wrap the items in the first column and set the column width of the first row to 50 pixels.

<p><div class="scrollbox" style="display: grid;height: 100%;" tabindex="0">
		<pre class="scrollbox-content">addStyle(wb, 2, style = createStyle(wrapText = TRUE), rows = 1:7, cols = 1)
setColWidths(wb, 2, 1, widths = 50)</pre></div>

	<p>Last, we'll save the workbook with the report name and date and we are done!

	<p><div class="scrollbox" style="display: grid;height: 100%;" tabindex="0">
		<pre class="scrollbox-content">saveWorkbook(wb, paste0(report_name, as_of_date, ".xlsx"), TRUE)</pre></div>

	<h3 class="article-subtitle">Final Thought - Why Automate?</h3>
	
	<p>For a one time report this may seem like a lot of work to add one tab with only 7 rows of text.  Why not just input the text directly into Excel?
	
	<p>I would agree this is overkill for one report.  However, there is a good chance that this code can be reused later.  It could be packaged into a function as well, depending on your need.
	
	<p>The value really rears its head when you start producing multiple reports - super handy!  That is something I will be tackling on a future post and look forward to sharing with you.  
	
	<p>Thanks for reading - I would appreciate any feedback.  <a href = "https://github.com/harryahlas/sample-hr-database/blob/master/analysis/data_disclaimer_tab.R">Here</a> is a link to the code.
