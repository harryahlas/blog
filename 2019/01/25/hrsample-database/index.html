    <h1 class="article-title">The "hrsample" Package and Database</h1>

    <span class="article-date">2019/01/25</span>


<p>I am excited to announce the initial release of <b>hrsample</b>, a fictitious human resources database!  Though still a work in progress, I am very proud to be able to share it with you.

<p>Why build an HR database?  Several reasons.  Primarily, I feel like online sample HR databases tend to be clean and simple.  But data in the real world is usually messy.   With hrsample I wanted something dirty and gritty, like real world data.  Data that comes in several confusing tables with lots of NAs.  Not a single spreadsheet.

<p>If systems were designed perfectly and data was always clean, like in many of the sample HR databases you see online, then all we would need is a single business intelligence tool for this work and I might be out of a job.

<p>Also, I wanted my own database that I can use to help illustrate examples with both R and SQL.  I figure using one central data source will bring some consistency to the exercises I present there.  For this reason, hrsample comes in multiple formats: an R package and a MySQL database.  

<p>And of course I wanted something I could control.  Say I want to do an analysis on some of the data, I have the ability to make changes to the database.  For example, I can create teams with high turnover and poor performance to help with an analysis on good managers vs. bad managers.

<p>This database is fully reproducible.  You can refer to the code on GitHub to see how I built it.

<p>Additionally, you can modify the parameters and input files to your taste and create your own HR database using this code!


    <h2 class="article-subtitle">How to Install hrsample</h1>

<p>Use the code below to install from GitHub. This should take no more than a couple minutes.  
	
<div class="scrollbox" tabindex="0">
 	<pre class="scrollbox-content">devtools::install_github("harryahlas/hrsample")</pre>
</div>

<p><i>Note: the only R package requirement is devtools. If you are unable to install this way, then you can copy that entire repository to your machine and install from the folder you save to.</i>

<p>Some of my examples will require you to access hrsample via a MySQL database. 
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jeffblackadar?lang=en">Jeff Blackadar</a> has an <a href="https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/getting-started-with-mysql-using-r#downloading-and-installing-mysql">excellent tutorial</a> on how to set up MySQL and MySQL Workbench on your machine and connect via R.  It takes around an hour and it was a gamechanger for me.  I can't recommend this tutorial enough!

<p>Once you have MySQL Workbench set up, it is easy to import hrsample to your local machine.  First, copy this folder, which houses the SQL to build the database, from here: <a href="https://github.com/harryahlas/sample-hr-database/tree/master/data/MySQLdump">https://github.com/harryahlas/sample-hr-database/tree/master/data/MySQLdump</a>. Paste the folder to your local machine, then open MySQL Workbench.  In the Navigator window, on the Administration tab, click Data Import/Restore. Then simply import from the folder you saved into.

<p>Please also note in these examples I have set the username and password as: <code>user='newuser', password='newuser'</code>

    <h2 class="article-subtitle">The Build</h1>

<p>If you are interested in seeing how I built this, or if you have suggestions how to improve, or if you want to build your own database like hrsample, please visit the hrsample development repository, <a href="https://github.com/harryahlas/sample-hr-database/">https://github.com/harryahlas/sample-hr-database/</a>.  There are customizable parameters that you can specify - names of lines of businesses, jobs, employee distributions, and the like.

    <h2 class="article-subtitle">The Data</h1>
<p>I am not go into too much depth about the data here as I will save a lot of it for the exercises.  Here are a few graphics that show some of the data points available in the data set.  I have also included an EER diagram that shows the fields and relationships.
