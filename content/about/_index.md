Welcome! I am a Senior Data Science Advisor in human resources. Here I will share examples of People Analytics. I'll strive to simulate real world-like scenarios, using tools like R and SQL to wrangle data. I also plan to take occasional dives elsewhere in technology, including the exciting world of audio data using Python.
