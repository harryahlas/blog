Welcome! I am a People Analytics Manager in the financial industry. Here I will share examples of People Analytics reporting and analysis. I'll strive to simulate real world-like scenarios, using tools like R and SQL to wrangle data. I also plan to take occasional dives elsewhere in technology, including the exciting world of audio data using Python. My latest post is an efficient filesearch script. I hope it comes in handy for you!
