I want to share *Bescea*, an instant search engine for text.  This is perhaps most useful if you want to search through a data frame to find documents about a particular topic.

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("harryahlas/bescea")
```


## Run Bescea

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(bescea)
besceaApp(data = sneapsters,         
          text_field = "post_text",  
          unique_id = "textid")     
```

## Requirements

Requires RStudio (*reticulate* and *tidyverse* packages) and Python (*pandas*, *re*, *spacy*, *rank_bm25*, *tqdm*, *pickle*, *numpy*, *gensim*, and *nmslib* modules).
