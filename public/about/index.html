	<p>I fully intend for this blog to be a voyage. 
	
	<p>The worlds of people, banking, and audio data come crashing together here as I share my technology journey.
	
	<p>Currently, I am an Analytics Manager for the Team Member Insights group at Wells Fargo.  My undergraduate study was completed at Berkeley and I have a masters degree from the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill's #1 ranked <a href = "https://sils.unc.edu/">School of Information and Library Science</a>.  
	
	<p>I joined Wells Fargo Bank shortly after graduating SILS. Wells Fargo is the nation’s fourth largest bank and one of the top 20 biggest public companies in the world (Forbes 2013). It is a great place to work because the company strives to uphold the values of its vision to help satisfy customers’ needs and help them succeed financially.</p>

	<p>I am proud to play a role in bringing this vision to life. It is a critical time for my company as we are in a pivotal transition period. As a resulty, opportunities have opened up and I now lead the Wells Fargo Human Resources ALERT team.</p> 

	<p>My team is responsible for providing robust, reproducible reporting for human resources-related data for audit, regulatory, legal, and employee relations needs. Often, the tasks can be complex with very short timelines, so the job can be challenging.</p>

	<p>Prior to joining Human Resources, I worked with the Wells Fargo Regional Resource Planning team where I forecasted bank transactions. During my tenure there, we increased forecast accuracy from 76% to 95%.  I love predicting things.</p>

	<p>Outside of work, I enjoy putting technology to use related to music.  Whether it is audio engineering or machine learning applications related to audio, I am fascinated by the 1s and 0s that make up the waveforms so pleasing to our ears. I believe there is a whole world of doors that machine learning will be opening over the coming decades.</p>
	
	<p>Expect that this blog gets updated sporadically.  I'll share thing that I feel others may benefit from.  
	
	<p>If you have questions, corrections, or any comments, please reach out to me at my twitter account, link above.
